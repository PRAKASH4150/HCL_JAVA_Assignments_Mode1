Question No 4:

Answer:

       In the main class on line number 5 we are trying to access the variable 'a' of class A.But it throws an error because the variable 'a' is the private member of class A. Since it is 
a private member it cannot be accessed directly. It should be accessed with the help of getter method. It can be fixed by calling the getter method of class A instead of objA.a
